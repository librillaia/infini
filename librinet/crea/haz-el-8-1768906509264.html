        <h2>The importance of saying 'thank you'</h2>
        <p>Why is it so important to thank people <span class="fill-in-the-blank">for</span> things they do for us? My friend Josie, who works in a café, told me about a difficult customer she had to deal <span class="fill-in-the-blank">with</span> recently. The woman had insisted <span class="fill-in-the-blank">on</span> moving tables three times and had even asked <span class="fill-in-the-blank">for</span> dishes that weren't on the menu. She did this without smiling <span class="fill-in-the-blank">at</span> Josie, thanking her or even apologizing <span class="fill-in-the-blank">for</span> the fuss she was creating. There was no appreciation <span class="fill-in-the-blank">for</span> Josie's hard work and she felt very upset.</p>
        <p>When I heard <span class="fill-in-the-blank">about</span> this, it reminded me of the writer Melody Beattie. She strongly believes <span class="fill-in-the-blank">in</span> the importance of saying 'thank you'. She claims that gratitude helps us get more in life and that it turns what we have into more. I'm sure Rosie wouldn't argue <span class="fill-in-the-blank">with</span> that!</p>
